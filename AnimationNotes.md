## Skeletal Mesh vs Static Mesh

Static mesh has no skeletal system, skeletal animation will not workon it. Its just vertices and materials<br>

Skeletal Mesh, has a skeleton assigned to it, bones. Animations we bring will help animate skeleton<br>
Animation Sequences are only one thing.<br>
Animation BluePrints brings it all together <br>
BlendSpaces help transition from one animation to another
